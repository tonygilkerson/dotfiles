# dotfiles

This is explained in his [Blog Post](https://dev.to/jameson/bash-completion-for-git-on-mac-os-x-monterrey-3imd)

Jameson's . (dot) files for UNIX and Linux family command-line
environments.

One goal of these dot files is to converge on a similar experience
across some different UNIX/Linux systems that we encounter in the wild:

* Ubuntu
* Debian
* RHEL
* Amazon Linux
* Mac OS X
* etc.

## Setup

To install the dot files for a particular user on your system, do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesonwilliams/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/install.sh
```
