# zsh

I got a new MacBook Air 15in and decided to start using the defalut zshell

## zprofile

This is a good [reference](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles) on how DotFiles are used.  Looks like it is better to add my stuff to the profile instead of the rc file.

```sh
# Install

cat zsh/zprofile-my-mac-air >> ~/.zprofile
```
